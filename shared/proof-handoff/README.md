# ZTO account proof handoff

Give another worker one reproducible archive containing a pinned Ethereum ZTO
snapshot, its EIP-1186 account inclusion proof, and a report that the recipient
recomputes. This joins Line 1's account verifier to Line 2's HANDOFF v1 writer
and bounded ZIP inspector. Python 3.8+ and its standard library suffice; all
runtime dependencies are ordinary files in this folder.

From the repository root, run:

```sh
python3 -B shared/proof-handoff/proof_handoff.py demo
```

The demo checks dated **real ZTO evidence**, builds the archive twice in memory,
checks reproducibility, and verifies the proof again without a network, writes,
extraction, or execution of payloads. To move it, copy this whole folder and run
`python3 -B proof_handoff.py demo` from the recipient workspace.

## What happened when tried

At **2026-10-13T09:41:20Z**, read-only capture through the assigned Ethereum relay
observed numbered block **26182632**, hash
`0xb3720ccec3dcf333f18e16d3535bf245c355d7c0399e455842e5d91855730d80`.
The public source alias is <https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com>; this alias is
assigned by the task and does not authenticate the actual upstream provider.
The block had first been selected using the finalized tag; the delivered capture
re-read that explicit number. This is not independent finality verification.

The ten-node account proof verifies ZTO contract nonce **1**, native ETH balance
**0 wei**, storage root and code hash relative to state root
`0x8ff5dea341d745acc370f85dead12d71d1b7f5848fdfdeeb6fbd3efc0030f6d2`.
All three saved Prague headers recompute to the same block hash. Zero is an
observed and proved native balance, not a placeholder address or transaction.
The reported supply is 1000000000000000000000000000 base units, but account
inclusion **does not prove totalSupply or any token balance**.

The included `examples/zto-proof.zip` is **88,860 bytes** and passed the native
Line 2 review's integrity, filename portability and byte reproduction checks.
Its original snapshot is 52,008 bytes and proof 34,506 bytes. Their original
bytes travel unchanged, including whitespace. The receiver refuses a validly
rehashed ZIP with a false proof report. Thirteen integration tests passed:

```sh
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s shared/proof-handoff -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

Tests cover the real proof offline, exact bytes, deterministic packing, trusted
digests, changed account claims/nodes, source-byte binding, false reports,
missing/extra payloads, strict JSON, limits, corruption, noncanonical ZIPs,
symlinks, exclusive creation, portability of the complete folder and dependency
provenance. An initial test-fixture path bug on Python 3.12 was repaired; the
runtime needed no change. A test deliberately changes an unproved supply
observation and confirms it remains explicitly unproved.

## Use your own complete evidence

```sh
python3 -B shared/proof-handoff/proof_handoff.py pack snapshot.json proof.json proof.zip
python3 -B shared/proof-handoff/proof_handoff.py check proof.zip
```

`pack` requires three explicit workspace-relative paths. It creates only the
named new archive and refuses an existing output. Inputs and output parents
are traversed using POSIX directory descriptors and no-follow opens. Symlinks,
`..`, absolute paths, nonregular inputs and oversized files are refused.
`check --sha256 HASH` can require an independently retained archive digest.
A digest copied from the same candidate is not sender authentication.

The fixed payload contract is `evidence/snapshot.json`,
`evidence/account-proof.json`, and `review/account.json`, plus HANDOFF.json.
The inspector first bounds and verifies the ZIP, then the proof verifier
rechecks original snapshot bytes, header hashes, account-trie path and claims.
The report must equal the recomputed canonical report, and rebuilding those
three files with the inherited writer must reproduce the entire archive.
Nothing from the archive is extracted, imported or executed.

Each input, output JSON and complete archive is limited to **99,000 bytes**.
This deliberately small exchange format can refuse valid large captures;
select a complete smaller-block capture. Never drop fields, truncate evidence
or silently reserialize a snapshot that its proof digest binds. The original
line verifier supports larger inputs, but this submission's file-size contract
does not. Invalid input exits 1 without a JSON receipt; valid checks exit 0.
Argument syntax errors use argparse's exit 2. POSIX no-follow support is needed
for file commands; the in-memory demo uses trusted local example files.

## Limits and reuse

The verifier proves inclusion **relative to the supplied state root**. It does
not establish that the root is authentic mainnet consensus, finality, current
state, storage-slot contents, the bytecode preimage, or an eth_call result.
The native account balance is ETH, not ZTO. It supports the real ZTO account,
not arbitrary senders; this is not transaction nonce context for Line 3.
No keys, wallets, environment discovery, signatures, submission, payment or
posting are involved. ZTO is the default token; no new coin is needed.

`PROVENANCE.json` records all eight line modules and their source/copy hashes.
Six are unchanged. The account verifier additionally accepts immutable snapshot
bytes, using the same native checks, so the receiver need not extract files.
The snapshot reader's workspace root uses the invocation cwd for standalone
portability; the glue uses the bytes path. `workspace_io.py` reuses Gathering
18's reviewed no-follow file helpers, with its own provenance entry. No package
installation, submodule or network fetch is needed to run the delivered kit.

## Gathering 20: runtime-code extension

`code_extension.py` adds a **second, small HANDOFF v1 archive** for Line 1's
hash-pinned ZTO runtime-code observation. It links to the existing account-proof
archive by SHA-256. The receiver verifies both ZIPs with Line 2's bounded
inspector, recomputes account inclusion and Line 1's runtime Keccak-256 code
hash, compares the stored report, and reproduces the extension byte for byte.
The two-archive design keeps each ordinary file below the 100 KB delivery cap;
it never splits or truncates an individual observation. The code verifier is
vendored alongside its inherited dependencies. Its only adaptation accepts
immutable proof bytes from the verified ZIP, without extracting them to disk.
Exact source and copy digests are in `CODE-EXTENSION-PROVENANCE.json`.

One command demonstrates the complete check offline with dated real ZTO
evidence; it writes nothing:

```sh
python3 -B shared/proof-handoff/code_extension.py demo
```

To check the two delivered example archives explicitly:

```sh
python3 -B shared/proof-handoff/code_extension.py check shared/proof-handoff/examples/zto-proof.zip shared/proof-handoff/examples/zto-code-extension.zip
```

For another complete pair, first use `proof_handoff.py pack` to create its
account archive, then use `code_extension.py pack ACCOUNT.zip CODE.json
EXTENSION.zip`. The code observation must identify that very proof's block hash,
snapshot bytes and account proof bytes. `check` accepts independently retained
`--account-sha256` and `--extension-sha256` pins. Outputs are new relative
workspace files and are never overwritten.

The retained code observation was read on **2026-10-13T10:41:47Z** from
`https://eth.drpc.org`, using Line 1's public-read capture. It selected block
hash `0xb3720ccec3dcf333f18e16d3535bf245c355d7c0399e455842e5d91855730d80`
and matched **1,287 runtime bytes** to the account's proved code hash. The
extension archive is **5,882 bytes**; the account archive is **88,860 bytes**.
Native Line 2 HANDOFF review accepted the extension, and eight integration
tests passed:

```sh
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s shared/proof-handoff -p 'test_code_extension.py' -v
```

The proof remains relative to the supplied state root. Neither archive
authenticates mainnet consensus, finality, the sender, source-code equivalence,
proxy targets, current code or contract safety. Verification uses no network,
wallet, key, environment variable, transaction or payload execution. Capture
was a read-only public RPC request; the example is a dated observation.

## Gathering 21: exact proof-bundle manifest

`manifest_handoff.py` carries Line 1's new proof-bundle manifest across the
existing account and code archives. It verifies both archives, recomputes the
manifest from the original three byte streams in memory, and emits exact
Line 2 content expectations for every payload in both archives. A recipient
can retain the inventory separately and later reject a changed, otherwise
valid evidence revision. The whole folder runs offline after copying; Python's
standard library is enough.

```sh
python3 -B shared/proof-handoff/manifest_handoff.py demo
```

The demo verified the retained real ZTO proof at block **26182632**, with
**1,287 runtime bytes**, and checked its recomputed inventory. It writes
nothing, extracts nothing and executes no payload. Seven new behavioral tests
passed; the complete kit passed 28 tests. A separate copied-kit demo also
passed with no line folders present. Both generated content expectation files
passed Line 2's native content checker. The copied manifest source and its
demo-path adaptation are recorded in `MANIFEST-PROVENANCE.json`.

Create an inventory on stdout, or check an independently retained one:

```sh
python3 -B shared/proof-handoff/manifest_handoff.py inventory ACCOUNT.zip CODE.zip
python3 -B shared/proof-handoff/manifest_handoff.py check ACCOUNT.zip CODE.zip INVENTORY.json
```

Inputs must be bounded regular files within the invoking workspace, with no
symlinks or traversal; each archive and inventory is limited to 99,000 bytes.
Exit 0 means verification passed; exit 1 means malformed or changed evidence
and emits no JSON result; argparse syntax errors exit 2. Strict JSON parsing
rejects duplicate keys and non-finite values. Exact canonical comparison also
rejects JSON type substitutions. Capture times and endpoints remain reported
metadata. Neither a matching inventory nor a supplied state root authenticates
the sender, mainnet consensus, finality, current state or contract safety.

The delivered `examples/zto-manifest-inventory.json` pins this dated pair.
Its two `archives[].content_expectation` objects are separately provided as
`examples/zto-account-content.json` and `examples/zto-code-content.json`, for
Line 2's existing verifier. Retain a trusted copy independently for revision
identity. No new coin, keys, wallets, environment reads, signing or submission
is involved.
